Ottodot Assessment

Implementation Notes
My Implementation:
- I just strictly implemented what was asked.
- I added a simple Primary Grade number selector from 1 to 5 that simply changes the Primary level indicated in the AI Prompt 
- My challenge was managing the session id where the issue is in saving the unique session id to database, to solve it I just clear the session id in cache
